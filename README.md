# This is a game that I made over the summer after my sophomore year of high school, I had recently learned Javascript, HTML, and a few other programming languages and I wanted to test my knowledge.

# This is just a simple snake game, eat the multi-colored pellets, dont eat yourself and don't run into any walls, I was keeping it simple.
